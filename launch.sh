# Stocklimit launch: deploys everything from ONE dev wallet and exports the addresses to the website.
#   1. The order side (contracts/, Foundry): RouterStocklimit, QuoterStocklimit and BookStocklimit
#      (limit, take-profit, stop-loss, bracket orders, partial fills). No owner on any of them.
#   2. The vault protocol (vaults/, Hardhat): Vaults, oracle, swap adapter, fee router, BuyBurn, Borrow Desk,
#      Basket program, registry and the 48h timelock. The dev wallet is the timelock's proposer/executor, the
#      guardian and the treasury. The keeper is a separate bot wallet (it has to sign on its own).
#
#   ./launch.sh               real deploy to Robinhood Chain
#   ./launch.sh --rehearsal   the same on a local copy of the live chain; spends nothing
#
# The dev wallet signs from ~/.foundry/keystores/$DEPLOYER_ACCOUNT (default stocklimit-dev, made by
# `node tools/wallet.js create stocklimit-dev`), unlocked with ~/.foundry/stocklimit.pw. No key is typed or printed.
